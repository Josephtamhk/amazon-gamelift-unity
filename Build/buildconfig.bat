REM THIS BATCH FILE IS CALLED FROM BUILD.BAT WITH A NAMED CONFIGURATION NAME AS A PARAMETER. THE BATCH FILE BUILDS THE UNITY
REM PROJECT INTO THE IMAGE OF THE SAME NAME. THIS MEANS WE CAN HAVE A UNITY DEBUG SERVER BUILD, A UNITY RELEASE CLIENT BUILD AND
REM SO ON, WHICH OTHERWISE REQUIRES TO BE MANUALLY SET UP IN THE UNITY EDITOR.

REM PLUGINS MUST ALREADY BE BUILT BY NOW

REM IS THIS A NAMED CONFIGURATION?

REM TASKKILL KILLS THE UNITY.EXE PROCESS IF IT IS RUNNING. IF UNITY IS NOT RUNNING THEN IT WILL THROW AN ERROR MSG TO STDERR.
